#📊 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting the likelihood of diabetes using various machine learning models.
This project compares multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks (MLP).

#🧠 Objective
To develop and evaluate machine learning models that can predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic data.
